# Merge Intervals
The merge intervals pattern deals with problems involving overlapping intervals. Each interval is represented by a
start and an end time. For example, an interval of `[10,20]` seconds means that the interval starts at `10` seconds and
ends at `20` seconds. This pattern involves tasks such as merging intersecting intervals, inserting new intervals into
existing sets, or determining the minimum number of intervals needed to cover a given range. The most common problems
solved using this pattern are event scheduling, resource allocation, and time slot consolidation.

#### Does your problem match this pattern?
Yes, if both of these conditions are fulfilled:
* Array of intervals: The input data is an array of intervals.
* Overlapping intervals: The problem requires dealing with overlapping intervals, either to find their union,
their intersection, or the gaps between them.

#### Real world problems.
* Display busy schedule: Display the busy hours of a user to other users without revealing the individual meeting slots
in a calendar. 
* Schedule a new meeting: Add a new meeting to the tentative meeting schedule of a user in such a way that no two 
meetings overlap each other.
* Task scheduling in operating systems (OS): Schedule tasks for the OS based on task priority and the free slots in the
machineâ€™s processing schedule.
