## Design Patterns
###### Resourced from educative.io.

Coding interviews are hard. You never know what question you’ll be asked, and there are so many of them!
To make matters worse, the interviewer expects you to eventually (if not immediately) converge on an optimal solution.

The good news, though, is that there are a handful of “coding design patterns” that can help you.
A coding pattern is a code blueprint that can be customized to optimally solve many related problems.

You don’t have to rely on rote memorization to learn the solutions to all coding interview problems.
Most coding problems can be distilled into generalized versions.
Mastering these design patterns gives you the tools to find the optimized approach to solve those problems.
The two key things you need to know to achieve this are:

How each pattern works.
How to decide which pattern to apply to a given problem.
